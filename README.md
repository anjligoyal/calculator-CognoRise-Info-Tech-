HTML Structure:
Start by creating an HTML file (let’s call it index.html). 
In this snippet:
We have a display screen with an initial value of 0.
There’s a “C” button to clear the screen.
You’ll add more buttons for digits (e.g., 1, 2, 3) and operations (e.g., +, -, *, /).

CSS Styling:
Create a styles.css file to style your calculator. You can center it on the page, adjust fonts, colors, and layout.
For instance, style the buttons to look like actual calculator buttons.

JavaScript Logic:
In your script.js file, write the JavaScript logic for the calculator.

You’ll need to implement functions for other operations (addition, subtraction, etc.).
Event Handling:
Attach click event listeners to the buttons. When a button is clicked, call the appropriate function (e.g., appendToScreen() or clearScreen()).
Math Operations:
Extend your JavaScript logic to handle mathematical operations. For example, when the user clicks the “+” button, update the display accordingly.
Advanced Features (Optional):
Implement decimal point handling, keyboard support, and more advanced operations.
